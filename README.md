# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1: Text preprocessing
- Text preprocessing is one of the important step while working on text.
- We have to spend more time in cleaning the data to get better results.
- I have created a module to preprocess text.
- Link to the module: [Text preprocessing](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/Text_preprocessing.ipynb)

## Day 2: Pandas: Part 1
- Pandas is one of the most used libraries by Data scientists.
- It contains some basic usage of Pandas.

## Day 3: Pandas: Part 2
- They are many tricks which makes our life easier instead of wasting time in writing long codes. So, I have explored Pandas library thoroughly so that I can save a lot of time while coding.
- Please feel free to explore the notebook.

## Day 4 and Day 5:
- Participated in the ZS Challenge organised by Hacker Earth. It was a four day challenge.
- [Link to the Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/zs-data-science-challenge-2018/)
- [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/ZS_Data_Science_Challenge)
- The Hackathon was awesome and the problem was challenging enough to test your skills.
- Secured a rank of 223 out of 4743 (top 5%).

## Day 6 - Day 12:
- Participated in the Machine Learning Challenge - "Predict the damage to a building" organised by Hacker Earth.
- [Link to the Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/machine-learning-challenge-6-1/)
- [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/Predict-the-damage-to-a-building-ML-Challenge)
- It is a Classification problem which involved a lot of preprocessing, joining tables. The data is huge which also helps us to solve the challenge in an optimized way.
- I faced a lot of problems like Data balancing, duplicate data, hyper parameter tuning. It's quite interesting.
- This project helped me alot in learning different ways to handle huge data.
- Secured a rank of xxx out of xxxx.

## Day 13:
- Participated in the American Express AI Challenge(Problem 2) - "Supervised Modeling with Emphasis on LAUC
" organised by Hacker Earth.
- [Link to the Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/hiring/ai-problem-statement-2/)
- [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/Supervised-Modeling-with-Emphasis-on-LAUC)
- It is a Binary Classification problem. This problem involves chosing the correct algorithm(modelling).
- Secured a rank of xxx of xxxx.
