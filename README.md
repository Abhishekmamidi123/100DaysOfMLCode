# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1: Text preprocessing
- Text preprocessing is one of the important step while working on text.
- We have to spend more time in cleaning the data to get better results.
- I have created a module to preprocess text.
- Link to the module: [Text preprocessing](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/Text_preprocessing.ipynb)

## Day 2: Pandas: Part 1
- Pandas is one of the most used libraries by Data scientists.
- It contains some basic usage of Pandas.

## Day 3: Pandas: Part 2
- They are many tricks which makes our life easier instead of wasting time in writing long codes. So, I have explored Pandas library thoroughly so that I can save a lot of time while coding.
- Please feel free to explore the notebook.
