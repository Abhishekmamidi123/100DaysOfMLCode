# 100DaysOfMLCode

## Day 1: Text preprocessing
- Text preprocessing is one of the important step while working on text.
- We have to spend more time in cleaning the data to get better results.
- I have created a module to preprocess text.
- Link to the module: [Text preprocessing](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/Text_preprocessing.ipynb)

## Day 2: Pandas: Part 1
- Pandas is one of the most used libraries by Data scientists.
- It contains some basic usage of Pandas.
- Link to the notebook: [Pandas Part 1](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/2_pandas_part_1.ipynb)

- [Link to the official Pandas Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Day 3: Pandas: Part 2
- They are many tricks which makes our life easier instead of wasting time in writing long codes. So, I have explored Pandas library thoroughly so that I can save a lot of time while coding.
- Please feel free to explore the notebook.

## Day 4 and Day 5:
- Participated in the ZS Challenge organised by Hacker Earth. It was a four day challenge.
- [Link to the Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/zs-data-science-challenge-2018/)
- [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/ZS_Data_Science_Challenge)
- The Hackathon was awesome and the problem was challenging enough to test your skills.
- Secured a rank of 223 out of 4743 (top 5%).

## Day 6 - Day 12:
- Participated in the Machine Learning Challenge - "Predict the damage to a building" organised by Hacker Earth.
- [Link to the Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/machine-learning-challenge-6-1/)
- [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/Predict-the-damage-to-a-building-ML-Challenge)
- It is a Classification problem which involved a lot of preprocessing, joining tables. The data is huge which also helps us to solve the challenge in an optimized way.
- I faced a lot of problems like Data balancing, duplicate data, hyper parameter tuning. It's quite interesting.
- This project helped me alot in learning different ways to handle huge data.

## Day 13:
- Participated in the American Express AI Challenge(Problem 2) - "Supervised Modeling with Emphasis on LAUC
" organised by Hacker Earth.
- [Link to the Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/hiring/ai-problem-statement-2/)
- [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/Supervised-Modeling-with-Emphasis-on-LAUC)
- It is a Binary Classification problem. This problem involves chosing the correct algorithm(modelling).

## Day 14:
- Data visualization using Seaborn
- [Link to the Notebook](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/100DaysOfMLCode/blob/master/14_Data_visualization_using_Seaborn.ipynb)
- [Link to the official Seaborn Documentation](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- Source - [Python for Data Visualization - using Seaborn](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL998lXKj66MpNd0_XkEXwzTGPxY2jYM2d)
- This Notebook contains different plots that were explored on sample datasets, that were provided by the Seaborn library.

## Day 15 - Day 19:
- Resumed my work on Machine Learning Challenge - "Predict the damage to a building" organised by Hacker Earth.
- [Link to the Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenge/competitive/machine-learning-challenge-6-1/)
- [Link to the Repository](https://github.com/Abhishekmamidi123/Predict-the-damage-to-a-building-ML-Challenge)
- Increased my score from 0.68571 to 0.72056 after spending a lot of time in tuning hyperparameters.

## Day 20:
- [A Complete Tutorial on Tree Based Modeling](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/)
- This tutorial explains about various topics such as:
  - What is a Decision Tree? How does it work?
  - Regression Trees vs Classification Trees
  - How does a tree decide where to split?
  - What are the key parameters of model building and how can we avoid over-fitting in decision trees?
  - Are tree based models better than linear models?
  - Working with Decision Trees in R and Python
  - What are the ensemble methods of trees based model?
  - What is Bagging? How does it work?
  - What is Random Forest ? How does it work?
  - What is Boosting ? How does it work?
  - Which is more powerful: GBM or Xgboost?
  - Working with GBM in R and Python
  - Working with Xgboost in R and Python
  - Where to Practice ?
- The tutorial is very intuitive and any one can understand the concepts easily. It is worth reading and spending time.
